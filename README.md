# GDP-Per-Capita-data-analysis
This is a analysis using SQL
In this analysis I answer some questions about the information of the different tables of this database

Some of principal task and queries used to answer and share the information were:
 - modify the columns or data type
 - update and replace info from the columns
 - Order by some specific criteria
 - Joining different tables to get specific queries
 - Use some math operations like the median, grow percent of GDP Per Capita, the average
 - Viewing which tables can be joining by a key column to relate each other
